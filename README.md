The base for the project is the PiCar-X by SunFounder with a Rapberry Pi 4. 


## Intended Use

A robot shall be able to drive thorugh a pre-defined parcours as fast as possible, while the operator is not physically present at the location of the parcours. 


## Requirements

### Stakeholder Requirements

#### StR01 - Solving a parcours from remote
With the robot, it shall be possible to perform a drive through a parcours with the operator not beeing physically present at the location as quickly as possible. 


### System Requirements

#### SysR02 - Remote Control
The system shall be able to control the movement of the robot remotely.

#### SysR03 - Lane Assist
The system shall provide a lane assist.

#### SysR04 - Optimization
The system shall provide the posibility to parametrize the software to improve the performance.


### Frontend Software Requirements

#### FR02 - Keyboard controls
The user should be able to control the robot with WASD (driving/steering) and EQ (turning the head). 
The keyboard controls should be responsive and not laggy.

#### FR03 - On-screen keyboard
The user should be able to control the robot with an on-screen keyboard/gamepad.
The on-scren keyboard should give feedback to the user if it's being pressed.

#### FR04 - Video feed
The user should see the robot's video feed so they know where they are going.

#### FR05 - Line Assist support
The software shall provide the possibility to engage the lane assist on the robot.

#### FR06 - Configuration of parameters
The software shall provide the possibility to configure the P and I factor of the robot's PI controller.



### Firmware SW Requirements

#### SW01 - Environment
The software shall run on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a Robot HAT board.

#### SW02 - Motion
The software shall be able to control the forward and backward motion.

#### SW03 - Steering
The software shall be able to control the direction of the robot's movement.

#### SW04 - Video
The software shall be able to provide a real-time video from the robot's camera.

#### SW05 - RemoteControl
The software shall be able to receive and process remote control commands.

#### SW06 - Lane Assist
The software shall be able to follow a given track.

#### SW07 - Minimum Turn radius
The software shall be able to follow a track with a radius of down to 30 cm.

#### SW08 - Gaps in the track
The software shall be able to be tolerant against gaps in the track marking of up to 25 cm.

#### SW09 - Configuration of parameters
The software shall provide the posibility to configure the PI controller.

## Software Architecture


The firmware is composed of different modules
 * The Lane Controller is responsible for calculating the position relatively to the track. Input data are the three grey values from the grey scale sensor. Output data is a value in float, while 0 means the car is exactly above the track, negative values means it is left of the track, positive values right.
 * the PiControlle is responsible for calculating a direction command as the result of the calculated position above the track.
